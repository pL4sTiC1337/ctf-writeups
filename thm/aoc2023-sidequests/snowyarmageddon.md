## Breaching the CyberPolice perimeter
Ho ho, lads and lasses! Van Spy's whispers are golden! By pickin' apart the packet data we've sniffed out a mysterious device in the CyberPolice building. Seems like this old thing's been forgotten in their tech upgrade blizzard. It's as neglected as a lone iceberg.

This clunky old device is a buzzin', ripe for the pickin'. If we can get our claws into this enigmatic device, we'll have ourselves a sly backdoor right into the CyberPolice's icy fortress. Imagine the treasure troves of secrets just waitin' to be plundered! And oh, the cherry on top – we might just finagle our way into Frost-eau's laptop. That'll spill the beans on this Best Festival Company and AntarctiCrafts merger. McSkidy, that clever elf who snagged me last time, ought to keep an eye over her shoulder!

Remember, though, nothin' in the South Pole comes easy. But am I, the Bandit Yeti, the one to back down from a challenge? Never! Let's roll up our sleeves and dive into this digital snowstorm. The Bandit Yeti don't wait for no winter!

### The Yeti Hints!
Alright, my frosty friend, it's time to gear up for a simulated red team engagement. Think like the Yeti – be stealthy, keep it low-profile. We're treadin' through digital snow here, so make sure to minimize any detectable noise. It's like stalkin' a penguin in a blizzard; you gotta be silent, you gotta be sneaky. Now, if you get noisy at any point, don't get all ruffled if you hit a wall and find yourself blocked. It happens to the best of us, even the Bandit Yeti. Sometimes you gotta backtrack to the start, rethink your strategy. It's all part of the icy dance.

Your main target? Access that internal-only web application. That's where the juicy stuff is hidden. Now, gettin' full privileges on the machine – that's a tasty bonus, but don't sweat it if it's out of reach. The key is to complete the mission without kickin' up a snowstorm.

Remember, this is all about bein' as silent as the falling snow and as cunning as the arctic fox. Ready? Let's dive into this digital blizzard and show 'em what the Bandit Yeti's made of!
