## Frosteau's Laptop
Heh, well done! You've clawed your way through the CyberPolice's outer defenses. But don't get too cozy yet, you're still a pup in this pack with only limited reach in their network. If you wanna run with the big yetis, you gotta ice Frosteau's machine. That's where the juicy bits hide, all those case files, the whole stash. With that, you'll be howlin' with insight into their network. But keep your eyes peeled; Frosteau's no lone wolf, and with Elf McSkidy by his side, they've snuffed your trail before. Tread light, tread smart, stay frosty!

### The Yeti Updates
After the first few of the Yeti’s crew got through Cyber Police defences quickly, McSkidy helped lock down the system. With a new update in place, they think they’re safe!

This challenge machine was updated with a new version about 12 hours after release. After locking down an unintended path, the challenge is considerably more difficult, bringing it back to the original design. At the time of the update, 21 people had already finished the challenge and found the Yeti Key. As a result, and to keep it fair, the Yeti offers you a hint for one of the questions below. Your choice if you want to use it!

In addition to the 3 winner prizes for the first finishers of the room, we will award three additional prize packages to the first three people to complete the challenge after the update! Before you claim this prize, we’ll email you to verify you have solved the updated version of the challenge.

### Questions
1. What is the value of the first flag?
2. What is the value of the second flag?
3. What is the value of the third flag?
4. What is the value of the fourth flag?
5. What is the value of the third Yetikey that has been placed in the root directory to verify the compromise?
